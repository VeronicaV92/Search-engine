Instructions - Project 1 - Veronica Venturi

NOTE: nltk stopwords corpus is needed

You can check the search.py program using the two folders I included. 
So put them in your current directory and use the command "python search.py".
The program will ask you the words you want to search. Type them and press Enter. 
The program will print out the results.

Otherwise, you can execute these three commands: 
"python collect.py"
"python index.py"
"python search.py"
